in this block, I would like to see analytics of sellers and products presented on our marketplace. You have been provided with the following data: sellers, products â€“ based on them, 
you need to build an analytical report, including: the sellers with the biggest/smallest turnover, leaders/outsiders in sales in each area. For products, we are interested in turnover 
analytics, which products sell best in each category, as well as the dependence of product weight on turnover and price. It is also interesting to see the segmentation of sellers and products
with textual conclusions regarding the business value of using these results.
